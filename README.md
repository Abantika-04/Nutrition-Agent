# The Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant

## 📌 Problem Statement
In an era where health awareness is growing, individuals increasingly seek personalized nutrition guidance. 
However, most existing tools provide **generic diet plans**, lack **real-time adaptability**, and fail to consider:
- Holistic lifestyle factors  
- Cultural & religious food preferences  
- Allergies & medical conditions  
- Dynamic adaptation to evolving health goals  

Dieticians and nutritionists also face **scaling limitations**, making personalization hard to achieve.

### 🎯 The Challenge
Build **The Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant** using **Generative AI** that:
- Understands user input via **text, voice, or images** (food photos, grocery labels)  
- Generates **personalized meal plans** (health goals, conditions, routines, preferences)  
- Provides **contextual explanations** (e.g., “Why is this food better?”)  
- Learns & adapts dynamically from **continuous feedback**  

This AI bridges the gap between one-size-fits-all diet apps and **real nutrition counselling**.

## 📊 Example Use Case
**Input:**  
> I am from kolkata. can you suggest me vegeterian meals options?  

**Output (AI Generated):**  
- Breakfast: Vegetable upma with sprouts (350 kcal, 15g protein)  
- Lunch: Brown rice with dal, sautéed beans (550 kcal, 20g protein)  
- Snack: Roasted makhana + buttermilk (150 kcal, 6g protein)  
- Dinner: Paneer curry (no onion/garlic) + chapati + salad (500 kcal, 25g protein)

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Full multimodal support (voice input + food photo recognition)  
- Continuous learning from wearable/sensor data  
- Export diet plans in **PDF/CSV** for doctors/nutritionists  
- Integration with **fitness trackers** & **blood sugar monitors**
